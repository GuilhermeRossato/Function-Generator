# Function-Generator

Mathematical functions are crucial to computer science, they describe everything from motion tweening of particles to the path of the sun in a game, sometimes you need one type, sometimes a different one, creating them by hand is expensive, unnecessary, and predefined functions don't cover much ground in this field. It's also easy to automate the task.
