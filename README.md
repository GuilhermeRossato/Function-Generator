# Function-Generator
A browser app to generate multi purpose functions using interpolation.

Saying "Functions are useful" is an understatement, they describe everything from motion tweening to the path of the sun in a game, sometimes you need one type, sometimes a different one, creating them by hand is expensive, unnecessary, and predefined functions don't cover much ground in this field. It's also easy to automate the task.
